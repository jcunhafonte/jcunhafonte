# José Cunha Fonte

### 🚧 Build, Maintain, Repeat.

Hi, I'm José from Portugal! I'm always looking to be inspired, to envision the uncommon, and to work hard for worthwhile things. Somehow I always find myself surrounded by people like me, who bring out the best in me. 🤙 My team knows I lead from behind because that's my style: Trust and Empower.


🧬 Give back to the Dev ecosystem as an open-source contributor;

🚀 Bring my startup and enterprise experience to any project, big or small;
📝 Manage dev teams, because I believe people are not blockers. Ever.


<br/>
I see working as an ongoing education. I am always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. ✅

<br/>
<br/>
When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably surfing 🏄, writing 📓, petting dogs 🐕, fighting for social causes #️⃣ or playing drums 🥁.

<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to create something exhilarating while co-working with inspirational people. ✨ 🌈
