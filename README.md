# José Cunha Fonte

### 🚧 Build, Maintain, Repeat.

Hi, I'm José from Portugal! I'm always looking to be inspired, to envision the uncommon, and to work hard for worthwhile things. Somehow I always find myself surrounded by people like me, who bring out the best in me. 🤙 My team knows I lead from behind because that's my style: Trust and Empower.


🧬 Give back to the Dev ecosystem as an open-source contributor;

🚀 Bring my startup and enterprise experience to any project, big or small;

📝 Manage dev teams, because I believe people are not blockers. Ever.


What some call a 'job', I call a university. Constant learning is my motivation. I am always looking for opportunities to work with those who want to share their knowledge as much as I want to receive it. ✅


When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably surfing 🏄, writing 📓, petting dogs 🐕, playing with my little one 👶, or playing drums 🥁.


My goal is to create something exhilarating while co-working with inspirational people. 


I don't know why I always end up creating exhilarating things alongside inspiring people. Is it just luck? 🍀 Or is it something more... ✨ 🌈
